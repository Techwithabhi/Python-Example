'''
Exapmles:
    Take = 5
    Square of 5 = 25
    Ends with 5 → ✅ Automorphic

    Take = 76
    Square of 76 = 5776
    Ends with 76 → ✅ Automorphic

    Take = 25
    Square of 25 = 625
    Ends with 25 → ✅ Automorphic

    Take = 7
    Square of 7 = 49
    Does not end with 7 → ❌ Not Automorphic
